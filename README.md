# Alvin Yearby HTML CSS Git Challenge 
For this challenge I worked in the eyes of a developer. I took an exsiting clients website and refactored the code to make the website more acessible to people with disabilites. I did this by making sure the website's navigation tags were all working correctly and all the photos contained alt tags in its HTML. I also cleaned up the HTML, by giving each element the correct tags, and by naming all the sections. I Also cleaned up the CSS style sheet by reducing mutiple reapeated styles, organizing the styles to make sure the same section styles were together, and naming what section each styles were meant for.
